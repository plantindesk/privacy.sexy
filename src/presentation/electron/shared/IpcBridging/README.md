# IPC bridging

This module introduces structured and type-safe inter-process communication (IPC) to Electron applications,
enhancing the development and maintenance of complex features.

## Benefits

- **Type safety**: Ensures reliable data exchange between processes and prevents runtime errors through enforced
  type checks in IPC communication.
- **Maintainability**: Facilitates easy tracking and management of inter-process contracts using defined and clear
  interfaces.
- **Security**: Implements the least-privilege principle by defining which members are accessible in proxy objects,
  enhancing the security of IPC interactions.
- **Simplicity**: Simplifies IPC calls by abstracting the underlying complexity, providing a more straightforward
  interface for developers.
- **Scalability**: Structured IPC management supports effective scaling and reduces the challenges of ad-hoc
  IPC implementations.
