# Context Bridging Module

This module establishes secure, maintainable, and efficient inter-process communication between the preloader
and renderer processes.

## Benefits

- **Security**: Exposes intended parts of an object to the renderer process, safeguarding the application's
  integrity and security.
- **Type Safety and Maintainability**: Offers type-checked contracts for robust and easy-to-maintain code.
- **Simplicity**: Streamlines the process of exposing APIs to the renderer process, minimizing the complexity
  of context bindings.
- **Scalability**: Enhances the scalability of API exposure and simplifies managing more complex API structures,
  overcoming the limitations of ad-hoc approaches.
